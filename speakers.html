    <h2>Hui Cheng</h2>
    <h3>Affiliation: Sun Yat-sen University</h3>
    <h3>Title: Autonomous Robots and Collaborative Multi-robot Systems</h3>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> It is challenging for robots to autonomously complete tasks such as exploration and dexterous manipulation in complex environments. The talk will describe the research work of the RAPID Robotics Laboratory of Sun Yat-sen University in the direction of autonomous robots and the collaboration of multiple robots, including autonomous exploration of mobile robots, aerial flying arms, distributed collaboration of multi-unmanned systems, and vision-guided robotic arm, etc., and the talk will show the experimental results. At the same time, the talk will explore the direction of future in-depth and continuous research.</p>
    <p><strong>Biography:</strong> Hui Cheng is currently a Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou. Her research interests are in intelligent robots, multi-robot systems, robotic vision and networked control systems.</p>

    <h2>Cheng Tan</h2>
    <h3>Affiliation: Qufu Normal University</h3>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Due to limited bandwidth resources, signals are usually delivered over imperfect networks with transmission delays, channel fading, and even packet dropout. Incomplete information issues, together with intrinsic uncertainties in the modeled system, can degrade the performance of networked control system (NCS) and even destabilize the whole system. To sum up, stabilization of an uncertain NCS with incomplete information is a challenging problem with lots of works motivated in the past few decades. Facilitated by the techniques in stochastic control for time-delay systems, this project aims at solving the following stabilization control problems for the above-mentioned uncertain NCSs.</p>

    <h2>Lei Deng</h2>
    <h3>Affiliation: Theory Lab, Huawei</h3>
    <h3>Title: Stabilization control of uncertain networked system with incomplete information</h3>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Video data accounts for 80% of all Internet traffic, a figure expected to surge further with the rapid adoption of AIGV technology. Efficiently storing, instantly processing, and real-time transmitting massive video data continues to pose significant challenges. This talk will explore two root technologies developed at our theory lab aiming at addressing these critical challenges. One is semantic coding. Different from traditional bit-level video coding such as H.26x, semantic coding focuses on the content and meaning of the video data, ensuring that the most relevant semantic information is preserved and transmitted with priority. The other is real-time communications (RTC). Different from existing best-effort networks, RTC requires that data is transmitted within a given deadline. This fundamentally changes the network design philosophy and thus introduces challenges to redefine network systems. I will both present our theoretical research outputs and practical applications in both directions.</p>
    <p><strong>Biography:</strong> Dr. Lei Deng received his B.Eng. degree from SJTU, and his Ph.D. degree from CUHK. He was a visiting scholar at Purdue University and was an Assistant Professor at SZU. He joined Huawei Theory Lab in 2022 as a senior researcher. He has published 40+ research papers in top-tier venues, has led and completed one NSFC project as PI, has been granted 10+ patents in both US and China, and has designed 20+ key algorithms that were successfully deployed in Huawei’s products. His current research interest includes semantic coding, RTC, and data science.</p>

    <h2>Chi Wan (Albert) Sung</h2>
    <h3>Affiliation: City University of Hong Kong </h3>
    <h3>Title: Inspired by a Mentor: From My Final-Year Project to Recent Results on Coded Distributed Computng</h3>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk explores the research journey inspired by my mentor, Prof. Wing Shing Wong, beginning with my undergraduate final-year project on hierarchical cellular systems. I will highlight his influence on my research approach and development over the years. Transitioning from my first conference paper, I will delve into my recent advancements in coded distributed computing, discussing key results and innovations. This presentaton will showcase how early guidance shaped my current contributions to the field and my approach to advising PhD students.</p>

    <h2>Lin Yang</h2>
    <h3>Affiliation: 南京大学-智能科学与技术学院</h3>
    <h3>Title: 面向边缘端大模型推理的架构和算法研究</h3>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 大模型通过其卓越的学习和分析能力将改变人类生活并创造巨大社会经济效益。尽管大模型在云端表现出色，但其在边缘端设备上的应用受限于计算资源和存储限制。尤其是在大模型在进行边缘端推理任务时，流式到达的用户请求和用户数据对大模型的实时token处理、模型并行和参数调度产生较大的干扰，从而影响大模型的响应时间和吞吐量。本次报告介绍本人近期的相关工作，介绍对大模型的算法和架构等多个层次开展软硬件协同设计，提升大模型的性能等方面的研究。 </p>
